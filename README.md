## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Welcome! I've made this site to demonstrate what I built for my Kleiner Perkins console game project.

### Overview

I built a version of draw poker with some little twists of my own. 
If you're curious about what draw poker is, take a look here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draw_poker]
I added a spin where for a hefty price, you can pick a card in your hand and redraw that card!

Come take a look at how the game is played!

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kevinxu12/KPerkins/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
